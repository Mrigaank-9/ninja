# To solve this problem, we need to first understand the properties of the divisors of a number. If a number has an odd number of divisors, it means that it is a perfect square. This is because the divisors of a number come in pairs, except when the number is a perfect square, in which case the square root of the number is not paired with any other divisor.

# Therefore, to find pairs (L,R) such that the product of array elements in the range L to R has an odd number of divisors, we need to find pairs of indices (i,j) such that the product of array elements from i to j is a perfect square.

# We can use this observation to solve the problem efficiently. We can iterate over all pairs of indices (i,j) and compute the product of array elements in the range i to j. If this product is a perfect square, we increment a counter. Finally, we return the counter.

# Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

import math

def count_pairs(A):
    n = len(A)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, n):
            product *= A[j]
            if math.isqrt(product) ** 2 == product:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
A = [1, 4]
count = count_pairs(A)
print(count) # Output: 3

# Another example
A = [2, 3, 4]
count = count_pairs(A)
print(count) # Output: 1
