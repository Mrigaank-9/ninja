# To solve this problem, we can first find the maximum value 'M' of the 'A' array. We know that we need to carry at least 'M' tickets, since we need to be able to pay for the most expensive ride.

# Next, we can create an array 'dp' of size 'M+3', where 'dp[i]' represents the minimum number of tickets required to obtain a total value of 'i'. We can initialize 'dp[0]' to 0 and 'dp[i]' to a large number for all other values of 'i'.

# We can then iterate over the values of '1', '2', and '3' and update the 'dp' array as follows:

# For each value 'j' from '1' to 'M+2', we can update 'dp[j]' as the minimum of 'dp[j]', 'dp[j-1]', 'dp[j-2]', and 'dp[j-3]' plus one. This means that we consider all possible ways of obtaining a value of 'j' using one, two, or three tickets, and take the minimum number of tickets required among these possibilities.

# Finally, we can return the sum of the minimum number of tickets required for each value in the 'A' array.

# Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

def min_tickets(A):
    M = max(A)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (M+3)
    dp[0] = 0
    for j in range(1, M+3):
        for k in range(1, 4):
            if j-k >= 0:
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-k]+1)
    min_tickets = 0
    for a in A:
        min_tickets += dp[a]
    return min_tickets

# Example usage
A = [2, 5, 10]
min_tickets = min_tickets(A)
print(min_tickets) # Output: 4
