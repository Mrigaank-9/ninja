# To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We can define a 2D array 'dp' where dp[i][0] represents the maximum length of a subsequence of the first i elements of 'Arr' such that the sum of the subsequence is even, and dp[i][1] represents the maximum length of a subsequence of the first i elements of 'Arr' such that the sum of the subsequence is odd.

# We can fill in the values of 'dp' using the following recurrence relation:

# dp[i][0] = max(dp[j][1] + i - j - 1, dp[j][0])
# dp[i][1] = max(dp[j][0] + i - j - 1, dp[j][1])

# Here, j ranges from 0 to i-1, and represents the last index of a subsequence that ends before i. If we add the element at index i to this subsequence, we get a new subsequence that ends at index i. If the sum of the new subsequence is even, its length is i-j. Otherwise, its length is the same as the length of the previous subsequence, which is dp[j][0] or dp[j][1] depending on whether the previous subsequence had an even or odd sum.

# The maximum length of a subsequence with an even sum is then the maximum value in dp[N][0].

# Here is the Python code to implement this approach:

def max_even_subsequence(Arr):
    N = len(Arr)
    dp = [[0, 0] for _ in range(N+1)]
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        for j in range(i):
            if (Arr[i-1] % 2 == 0 and sum(Arr[j:i]) % 2 == 0) or                (Arr[i-1] % 2 == 1 and sum(Arr[j:i]) % 2 == 1):
                dp[i][0] = max(dp[i][0], dp[j][1] + i - j - 1, dp[j][0])
                dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], dp[j][0] + i - j - 1, dp[j][1])
            else:
                dp[i][0] = max(dp[i][0], dp[j][0])
                dp[i][1] = max(dp[i][1], dp[j][1])
    return dp[N][0]

# Example usage
Arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
max_len = max_even_subsequence(Arr)
print(max_len) # Output: 4

# Another example
Arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
max_len = max_even_subsequence(Arr)
print(max_len) # Output: 4
